        Method syntax
            + Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name, 
              they can have parameters and a return value, 
              and they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else.
            + Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object) 
              and their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
